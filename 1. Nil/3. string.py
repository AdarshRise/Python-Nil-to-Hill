# Strings , well loved and hated
# it's a default/primitive type in python

# Let's make a string

" This is a string "
' This is a string '
''' This is a string '''
""" This is a string """

# All above are strings only,they won't affect the code directly,so Let's try printing them

print("This is a string",'This is a string','''This is a string''',"""This is a string""")


# Strings in variables
